# Moon data was adapted from JPL's "Planetary Satellite Mean Orbital Parameters" table:
# https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem
# and from JPL's "Planetary Satellite Physical Parameters" table, found here:
# https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_phys_par
# Columns are: Type,q,e,i,w,N,M,n,Epoch,H,G,Radius,ID,Name
# Type (PL) means Planet
# q is periapse distance (km)
# e is eccentricity
# i is inclination (deg)
# w is argument of perihelion (deg)
# N is longitude of ascending node (deg)
# M is mean anomaly (deg)
# n is mean motion (deg/day)
# Epoch is epoch of orbital elements (Julian Ephemeris Date)
# H is absolute visual magnitude (i.e., V at 1.0 AU distance and 100% illumination)
# G is magnitude phase parameter
# Radius is equatorial radius (km)
# ID is JPL NAIF ID
# Name is moon name
# Empty fields indicate unknown or missing values.
